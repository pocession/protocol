# One day before ELISA:
1.	Dilute capture antibody with designated coating buffer.
Add _________ ul of antibody in __________ ml coating buffer.
2.	Add 100ul of diluted capture antibody per well.
3.	Incubate at 4C for overnight.

# ELISA (Bring all things at RT before experiment)
4.	Discard capture antibody. Wash plate with wash buffer for four times. Blot the plate after each washing step. Wipe the bottom of plate with tissue at the final washing step. If itâ€™s not mentioned, follow these procedure at each washing steps.
5.	Add 200ul of assay diluent for each well.
6.	Incubate at RT for 4-5hr.
7.	During the incubation, prepare standard reagents and diluted samples.
8.	Discard assay diluent. Wash plate with wash buffer for four times. Add 100ul of standard reagents and diluted samples.
9.	Incubate at RT for overnight.
10.	Discard the sample by pipette man. Wash plate with wash buffer for four times. For the first and second time, use pipette man to aspirate waste and add new wash buffer. For the third and fourth time, wash plate as usual. Blot the plate after last two steps. Wipe the bottom of plate with tissue at the final washing step.
11.	Dilute detection antibody with assay diluent.
# Add _________ ul of antibody in __________ ml assay diluent.
12.	Add 100ul of detection antibody for each well.
13.	Incubate at RT for 1hr.
14.	Discard detection antibody. Wash plate with wash buffer for four times. 
15.	Dilute HRP antibody with assay diluent.
# Add _________ ul of HRP antibody in __________ ml assay diluent.
16.	Incubate at RT for 30min.
17.	Discard HRP antibody. Wash plate with wash buffer for five times.
18.	Add 100ul of TMB substrate for each well.
19.	Incubate at RT for 10-20min.
20.	Add 100ul of 2N H2SO4 to stop the color development.
21.	Spin down to remove bubble, read plate
