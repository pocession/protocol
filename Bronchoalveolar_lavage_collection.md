# Collect BAL
1.	500g, 5min, 4C, transfer all supernatant to another 1.5-ml tube.
2.	10000g, 5min, 4C, transfer all supernatant to another 1.5-ml tube, store at -80C. (For ELISA analysis)
3.	If there are many red cells, add 100ul ACK buffer to suspend cell pellet, or directly go to step 6.
4.	Stand at RT for 5 min.
5.	500g, 5min, 4C.
6.	Remove supernatant, suspend in 100ul of PBS-W, keep at 4C.
7.	Repeat the wash step again. (Step 6-7)
8.	Count cell number.
# staining for eosinophils
9.	Staining with No.22 (Zombine NIR), No. 5 (aCD16/32/aFcR, clone 93). Antibody dilution rate = 1/400X.
10.	Stand at 4C for 15min.
11.	Stain with NO.226 (BV510 aCD11b), No.223 (PerCP/Cy5.5 aSF), No. 205 (APC aF4/80), No. 175 (PE aCD11c). Antibody dilution rate, NO.226, No.223, No. 175 = 1/800X; No. 205 = 1/400X.
12.	Stand at 4C for 30min.
13.	Add PBS-W to 1ml. 
14.	4C, 500g, 5min, discard supernatant.
15.	Suspend cells with 1 00ul of 4% PFA.
16.	Stand at 4C for 15min.
17.	4C, 300g, 5min.
18.	Discard supernatant.
19.	Add 1ml of PBS-W, 4C, 300g, 5min.
20. Suspend with 100ul of PBS-W, store at 4C.
